 ## About The Project

Basis is an open-source social framework with VR and desktop usage, to be used to create your own social platform, games, ect.
Create whatever you desire! Your creativity is your limit.

By offering an open-source basis framework for anyone to contribute and customise, we aim to give users the power to break free from constraints that traditional social VR environments have set in place.

This project was created to help grow the VR space and provide a starting point for those who want to unleash their creative spirit and bring their vision to life.

Interested in helping create a better future for VR? Consider contributing or even donating!
